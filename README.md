## ðŸ“œ Gameplay Flow

**Begin the Journey**

Players select Runaâ€™s classâ€”Warrior, Mage, or Paladinâ€”and are equipped with a corresponding skill set. Each class influences Runaâ€™s abilities, and the choice determines your starting deck and overall strategy.

**Battle Mechanics**

Runa advances through a sequence of battles, each stage presenting unique monsters with progressively challenging abilities. Combat is turn-based, where players choose from available skills to strike, defend, or apply effects to survive and conquer.

**Skill and Health Management**

Health is crucial in survival, and Runa can heal by discarding skill cards through the `Heal` utility. Players must weigh the pros and cons of discarding useful skills to regain health, adding a tactical element to each encounter.

**Rewards and Advancement**

Upon defeating monsters, players can select new skill cards as rewards. Depending on the stage, the number of loot options varies, allowing players to strengthen Runaâ€™s deck and prepare for tougher enemies. These rewards enhance replayability by introducing customization.

**Climactic Boss Battles**

Each stage culminates in a boss fight where players encounter the most powerful foes, such as `Spider King` or `MegaSaurus`. These encounters push the player's tactical knowledge and resource management to the limit, serving as a capstone to each level.
